						<p>After the holiday high subsides, January comes along and hits us with a serious reality check — all that merrymaking has come to an abrupt end. And with it, a tough forecast: many more dark, cold, gloomy days of winter until the first signs of spring, which seems pretty far away.  The wedding venues at Turtle Bay include breathtaking beaches, a glass-walled wedding pavilion, and even a spot on the 18th hole of the Palmer Golf Course on the property.
